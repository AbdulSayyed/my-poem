## Introduction: 2.0

Due to Brexit, the whole nation is going through a phase what is known in psychology a cognitive dissonance. 
It would be interested to compare this dissonance among local groups and among groups between two nations one which is involved in 
Brexit and the one which is not. Aftermath of Brexit referendum has created an atmosphere of tension which makes people think 
twice about the decision. When taken as a unit the whole nation is divided into two major regions of nationsâ€™ brain. 
Each is trying to convince to itself and to the other side, to reduce this dissonance that the whole nation is suffering from. 
Can fMRI studies of groups belonging to different nations help understanding more about the nation's pattern of thinking ?
