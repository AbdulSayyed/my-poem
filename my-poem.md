## Introduction: 2.0

Due to Brexit, the whole nation is going through a phase what is known in psychology a cognitive dissonance. 
It would be interested to compare this dissonance among local groups and among groups between two nations one which is involved in 
Brexit and the one which is not. Aftermath of Brexit referendum has created an atmosphere of tension which makes people think 
twice about the decision. When taken as a unit the whole nation is divided into two major regions of nations’ brain. 
Each is trying to convince to itself and to the other side, to reduce this dissonance that the whole nation is suffering from. 
Can fMRI studies of groups belonging to different nations help understanding more about the nation's pattern of thinking ?

The Cognitive dissonance (contradiction) refers to a situation where a subject faces conflicting attitudes, beliefs and behaviours in oneself. These conflicting situations do not have to be contradictory beliefs but a simple choice between either two good options or bad options can create discomforts. In a healthy population reduction of dissonance occurs naturally as a mechanism to deal with the tension by adjusting the importance of one idea to make it less dissonant (Festinger,1957)[^1]. Studies show that the choice between two options results in activation of  left anterior insula (aINS) and in dorsal anterior cingulate cortex (dACC). These areas are often linked to cognitive conflict and to aversive emotional arousal. Another area found to be activated is posterior cingulate cortex (pCC) a region linked to self-processing (Kitayama, Chua, Tomposon, Han, 2012)[^2].

## Objectives: 2.1

This study initially aims to first find above mentioned regions followed by an attempt to find any possible relevance to orbitofrontal cortex (oFC) area often associated with patients suffering from Obsessive-compulsive-disorder (OCD). The study can also be used among participants belonging to different local groups to find any significant change just because of being in different group and later on between nations.

## Hypothesis: 2.2

When deciding between two choices which are already creating confusion in nations' mind, some activity is expected to occur in both region involved in decision making and cognitive dissonance as well as in another region that should give us some clue about prolonging the dissonance effects, which may be overlapping with other known mental issues.

## Ethics 2.3 

Higher Education Institution (HEI) Research Ethics Committees ( REC) guidelines are followed to conduct the experiment, informed consent is obtained from all the participants. Clear instructions are given to them and made sure that they understand what is involved in fMRI experiment and there are no biases present towards the trial.

## Participants: 2.4

30 healthy participants of age ranging 20-40, male and female (M=29.91, SD= 5.77) are recruited through  advertisements using bill boards for the above said fMRI experiment. Once an interested email is received, the preliminary questionnaire is sent to find out the suitability of the participants. They are also sent two video links to get familiarize about the fMRI experiment. If the suitability criteria are achieved, second mail is sent to the participant to make the first booking for their personal visit to the fMRI facility area. This meeting is arranged to give them an option for more informed decision about participating in the experiment and personally meeting them to verify their suitability to avoid any eleventh-hour disappointment. 

At the first visit, a screening form is given to the participant to be filled out all necessary medical related question which is essential for the validity of the experiment. Once suitability is confirmed, mutual consent is agreed then next booking for the 

All participants are invited on the same day of the experiment, they are verbally instructed not to have any metal device with them of whatsoever nature and lastly instructed not to move the head in order to get the good results. The procedure of pressing the button and answering the question is explained once again. Each participant is paid £80.00 in total for the two visits after the second visit.
